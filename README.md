# Castle-Defense

Project of a 2D game created in Unity where the objective is to defend against waves of enemies trying to bring down your castle.

The mechanics for defending your castle are as follows: You need to move to the quiver to pick up arrows if you don't have any (allies also consume arrows), and after defeating enemies, you earn gold based on the type of enemy.

With that gold, you can buy more arrows, repair the castle, or even purchase traps to defend the castle.

The project was completed in less than 1 month for a class assignment, and the sprites used were created by Javier Sirerol Braco.
